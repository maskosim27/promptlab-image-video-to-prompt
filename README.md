## What Is PromptLab?

PromptLab is a Chrome extension that turns local videos, web images, local image files, and short ideas into ready-to-use AI prompts. It is made for AI creators, prompt learners, visual reference study, and short video prompt reverse engineering.

PromptLab does not currently support full online video analysis from platforms like Instagram, TikTok, X, Facebook, or YouTube.

For video analysis, please upload a local video file.

## What Can PromptLab Do?

### Local Video to Prompt

![Local video to prompt](assets/local-video-to-prompt.jpg)

Upload a local video file. PromptLab samples key frames and creates separate reusable prompts for the visible shots.

- Best for short local videos under 60 seconds
- Extracts key frames automatically
- Designed for short creative videos, AI videos, ads, reels, and cinematic clips
- Default frame sampling mode: Standard
- Supports Fast / Standard / Detailed frame sampling modes
- Targets 5–10 seconds per segment; preserves source shots shorter than 5 seconds as short exceptions
- Infers visual hook, product demo/use, and CTA/closing beats from the shot sequence
- Optionally add outfit, background, and product reference images; their descriptions appear separately while prompt fields remain blank

### Web Image to Prompt

![Web image to prompt](assets/web-image-to-prompt.jpg)

Right-click a web image. PromptLab reads the image and creates a ready-to-use image prompt.

- Uses a dedicated image prompt template
- Outputs one clean Final Result prompt
- Optimized for image generation and visual recreation

### Local Image to Prompt

![Local image to prompt](assets/local-image-to-prompt.jpg)

Upload a local image file. PromptLab uses an image-focused template to create one final prompt for image generation.

- Uses the same image-oriented output style as web image analysis
- Outputs one clean Final Result prompt
- Built for image generation and visual recreation

### Prompt Enhancer

![Prompt enhancer](assets/prompt-enhancer.jpg)

Turn a short idea into a fuller prompt that is easier to copy and use.

- Includes a Video Prompt mode and an Image Prompt mode
- Video Prompt expands a short idea into a Seedance 2.0-style video prompt
- Image Prompt expands a short idea into a general image generation prompt
- Uses one clean Final Result output
- Works as an optional helper tool alongside the main image and video workflows

### Prompt History

- Automatically saves recent generation records
- Keeps up to 20 recent records

### Simple Output

- One unified result: Final Result
- No long analysis report
- No unnecessary labels like "Image Prompt:" or "Analysis:"
- Copy and use directly

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from Download ZIP, recommended for most users

1. Click Code -> Download ZIP on GitHub.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Turn on Developer mode.
5. Click Load unpacked.
6. Select the `dist/` folder.

Important:

- Select `dist/`
- Do not select the project root folder
- Do not select `src/`
- Do not select `assets/`

If there is no `dist/` folder in the downloaded ZIP, use Option 2 to build it manually.

After the extension loads, open Settings and add your Gemini API Key.

### Option 2: Build manually

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Terminal in the project folder.
3. Run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

4. After build finishes, open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
5. Turn on Developer mode.
6. Click Load unpacked.
7. Select the generated `dist/` folder.

After the extension loads, open Settings and add your Gemini API Key.

## Local Web Edition

The repository also builds a standalone browser UI alongside the Chrome extension. It supports local image and video uploads, video reference images, the prompt enhancer, frame-sampling settings, and prompt history. Web-image right-click analysis and extension background-worker features remain extension-only.

Run it locally with Node.js and npm:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run serve:web
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`. The server serves only `web-dist/` and binds to loopback; it is not a public web server. Stop it with `Ctrl+C`.

In the local UI, the Gemini API key and history persist in this browser's `localStorage` for the local page origin. Requests go directly from the browser to Gemini; PromptLab has no API proxy or backend. The extension continues using its existing extension-local storage.

## How to Get Free Gemini API Key?

PromptLab uses your own Gemini API Key.

You can get a Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio:

https://aistudio.google.com/

After you install the extension, open Settings and paste your Gemini API Key.

## API Key Privacy

Your Gemini API Key is stored locally in browser storage (extension storage for the extension; `localStorage` for the local web UI).

The project developer cannot see, collect, or access your API Key.

Images, video frames, and prompts may be sent to Gemini for analysis based on your Gemini API usage.

If you are worried about API usage or accidental exposure, you can set a daily API usage limit in Google AI Studio or Gemini settings.

## Settings

### Gemini API Key

Required. Used to send image or video frame analysis requests to Gemini.

### Frame Sampling Mode

This setting only applies to local video analysis.

Default mode: Standard

Available modes:

- Fast
- Standard
- Detailed

Fast:

- Fewer frames
- Faster analysis
- Best for quick prompt generation

Standard:

- Default recommended mode
- Balanced speed and prompt quality
- Best for most local videos

Detailed:

- More frames
- Better for complex motion, transitions, ads, and AI showcase videos
- Slower and may use more API resources

Image analysis does not use frame sampling settings.

## Video Frame Sampling

Fast:

- 5 frames
- 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%

Standard:

- duration <= 10s: 6 frames
- 10s < duration <= 30s: 10 frames
- 30s < duration <= 60s: 14 frames
- duration > 60s: 16 frames

Detailed:

- duration <= 10s: 10 frames
- 10s < duration <= 30s: 16 frames
- 30s < duration <= 60s: 24 frames
- duration > 60s: 32 frames

PromptLab samples from 0% to 95% of the video duration. It avoids 100% to reduce the chance of black frames or seek errors.

## Image Prompt Logic

Image analysis uses its own image-oriented prompt template.

It focuses on:

- Subject
- Scene
- Composition
- Style
- Lighting
- Color palette
- Mood
- Texture
- Material
- Perspective
- Visual quality
- Image generation keywords

## Video Prompt Logic

Video analysis is visual-only: it does not analyze on-screen text, voice, music, or sound effects. The final output is model-neutral and contains separate prompts for each inferred shot segment. Segments target 5–10 seconds; a source shot under 5 seconds remains a shorter exception, while longer shots are split at natural visible action or camera changes.

Each segment describes:

- Subject
- Scene
- Action
- Camera language
- Motion
- Pacing
- Visual continuity
- Cinematic structure
- Affiliate beat (when supported by the visible sequence)
- Blank `Outfit: [OUTFIT]`, `Background: [BACKGROUND]`, and `Product: [PRODUCT]` fields

Optional reference-image descriptions are shown separately from the prompts and never fill those three fields.

## Current Limitations

PromptLab does not support:

- Instagram video extraction
- TikTok video extraction
- X / Twitter video extraction
- Facebook video extraction
- YouTube video extraction
- DRM or protected video extraction
- m3u8 video downloading
- Streaming video parsing

For best video results, upload a local video file.

## Privacy

PromptLab uses your own Gemini API Key.

Your API Key is stored locally in browser storage (extension storage for the extension; `localStorage` for the local web UI).

The developer cannot access your API Key.

Depending on your Gemini API usage, images, video frames, and prompts may be sent to Gemini for analysis.

Do not analyze private, sensitive, or copyrighted content unless you have permission.

You can set a daily API usage limit in Google AI Studio.
